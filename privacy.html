        For the sake of simplicity, this privacy statement is in effect across all of my websites and services. I will try my best to show the services used in each individual location but there may be discrepancies when compared.

    <p>
        My opinions on privacy are clear and blunt - everything should centre around protecting and informing the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document exists to maintain transparency with any and all users of my websites and services. I will try my best to use language which is understandable and informative so as to make it accessible to all. If you disagree with, or simply do not like, anything listed in this document, you are free to stop using my websites and services. There is no data stored which is linked to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, if you have any questions that aren't answered in this document, feel free to <a href="/about#contact">contact me</a> and I'll respond as quickly as I can.

    <p>
        While this document is intended to be readable by anyone, there are a few things that are best explained by a definitions section. This is here to set out some basic definitions for this document.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>(the) site/website/page</strong> - this refers to the service or website used, for example htbrown.com;</li>

        <li><strong>analytical</strong> - technologies and services used to collect data on how the website is used and functions, which are active if present when consented to;</li>
        <li><strong>internal</strong> - services hosted by (including custom services and open source projects) HTBrown on infrastructure managed by HTBrown;</li>

    <p>
        These services and technologies are <strong>required for basic functionality</strong> and are <strong>always active</strong>. I aim to use services which collect as little data as possible.
