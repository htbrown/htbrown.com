    <p>Hey there!</p>
    <p>
        My opinions on transparency and privacy are clear and blunt - everything should always centre around protecting and informing the user. That's why this document exists; I'll be telling you exactly what technology and services I use to run this site so you know whether you want to stay on it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document is split up into two main sections: <a href="#functional">functional</a> and <a href="#analytical">analytical</a>. Details on what each of these terms mean can be found in the <a href="#definitions">definitions</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, if you have any questions that aren't answered in this document, feel free to <a href="/about/#contact">get in touch</a> and I'll respond as quickly as I can.
    </p>
