Welcome to version 5 of htbrown.com ðŸŽ‰

## Why change?

While I liked the former design of version 4, it was a pain to maintain (turns out using Vue isn't the best idea for a small website like this) and included things like a portfolio which, let's be honest, I don't really need and only added to the list of things to keep updated.

## "New" Technology?

I'm glad you asked!

I've switched back to Jekyll rather than using Vue for this website, and that's pretty much all that's different. Of course, I'm using HTML for the markup and I'm using SCSS for the styling, which I absolutely love - Jekyll building in a compiler for me is just an added benefit!

If you have a dig around you might be able to find the Easter egg I added; try not to cheat!

It's hosted on Vercel, as with my previous site, which is the easiest front-end hosting sites I've used, closely followed by Netlify. You can also access it through [GitHub pages](https://htbrown.github.io).

## Another Blog?

Yes, I've tried this before and it's never really turned out well.

This is likely to end up deserted once again, but it's really just here so I can ramble about things. It's not as if people will take the time to read things I write, so there isn't really harm in making another one.

## Final Notes

If you'd like to take a look at my (probably awful) CSS or think I should make a modification, [this site is on GitHub](https://github.com/htbrown/htbrown.github.io).

I'm generally pretty happy with the way it's turned out, but I'm always open to feedback. If you have something you'd like to say, [drop me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
