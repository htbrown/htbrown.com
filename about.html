<section>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Hayden, a fully self-taught full-stack developer and learning
    graphics designer from the East Midlands, UK. This is my humble corner of
    the internet!
  </p>
  <p>
    I've had an interest in computing and technology from a very young age, but
    have also recently developed an interest in music too. I intend to develop
    my music production skills in my spare time.
  </p>
  <p id="contact">
    If you feel the need to contact me, you can do so by
    <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">emailing me</a> or by contacting me
    through Discord; my tag is hayden#7084. If it's easier to use other means,
    get in contact through the prior methods and we can arrange something.

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <h3 id="tech">What technology do you have?</h3>
  <p>
    I will have a list of technology I use put up eventually on my
    <a href="https://htbrown.net">wiki</a>. Until then, you can see the
    equipment I have in use in my homelab,
    <a href="https://htbrown.net/shelves/homelab">available here</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="inline-heading" id="portfolio">Do you have a portfolio?</h3>
  <p>
    You can have a look at my (hopefully up to date)
    <a href="/work">work page</a>. If you want to see more (probably less
    polished and relevant) projects, take a look at my
    <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">GitHub page</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="inline-heading" id="programming-languages">
    What programming languages do you know?
  </h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript, C#, C++, Java, Python, Go, PHP and a bit of Swift.<br />
    There's likely more - I'm always up for learning another given a project,
    and tend to pick them up fairly easily.<br />
    I also know React (including Next.js and other derivatives), Vue, Cordova
    and various other web technologies.
  </p>
  <h3 class="inline-heading" id="website-tech">
    What did you use to make this website?
  </h3>
  <p>
    SCSS for styles, Jekyll for the static site generation, Strapi for the CMS and some JS for the work page and navigation.
