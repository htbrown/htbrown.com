<section>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Hayden, a fully self-taught full-stack developer, computer science student and learning
    graphics designer from the East Midlands, UK. This is my humble corner of
    the internet!
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest in the world of computer science stems from a very early age, when I was known to tinker with old technology and take things apart to figure out their function. From then, my interest in programming and making computers do what I wanted grew into what it is today. On a more general scale, I'm also a fan of technology and its development in itself; it's not uncommon to see me getting excited about the next incremental update to some technology I find interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
    My other interests include things like music, current affairs (along with the obligatory politics) and media like photography, video production and graphics design.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're interested, you can take a look at some of my recent <a href="/projects">projects</a> and the <a href="/uses">technology I use</a> day to day.

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="portfolio">Do you have a portfolio?</h3>
  <p>
    You can have a look at my (hopefully up to date)
    <a href="/projects">projects page</a>. If you want to see more (probably less
    polished and relevant) projects, take a look at my
    <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">GitHub page</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="work">Are you open for work?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you're interested, <a href="#contact">drop me a line</a> including what you're after and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="programming-languages">
    What programming languages do you know?
  </h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript (and TypeScript), C#, Java, Python, Go, PHP and a bit of Swift.<br />
    There's likely more - I'm always up for learning another given a project,
    and tend to pick them up fairly easily.<br />
    I also know React (including Next.js and other derivatives), Vue, Cordova
    and various other web technologies.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="website-tech">
    What did you use to make this website?
  </h3>
  <p>
    SCSS for styles, Jekyll for the static site generation, Directus for the CMS and some jQuery and standard JS.
