<section>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Hayden, a fully self-taught full-stack developer and computer science student from the East Midlands, UK. This is my humble corner of
    the internet!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm particularly interested in the world of computer science - that is the area I see myself persuing in the future - and currently build websites and manage infrastructure for myself and others. I hope to continue this as well as expand into other areas of computer science in the future.

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="portfolio">Do you have a portfolio?</h3>
  <p>
    You can have a look at my (hopefully up to date)
    <a href="/projects">projects page</a>. If you want to see more (probably less
    polished and relevant) projects, take a look at my
    <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">GitHub page</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="work">Are you open for work?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you're interested, <a href="#contact">drop me a line</a> including what you're after and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="programming-languages">
    What programming languages do you know?
  </h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript (and TypeScript), C#, Java, Python, Go, PHP and a bit of Swift.<br />
    There's likely more - I'm always up for learning another given a project,
    and tend to pick them up fairly easily.<br />
    I also know React (including Next.js and other derivatives), Vue, Cordova
    and various other web technologies.
  </p>
  <h3 class="heading-padded" id="website-tech">
    What did you use to make this website?
  </h3>
  <p>
    SCSS for styles, Jekyll for the static site generation, Directus for the CMS and some jQuery and standard JS.
