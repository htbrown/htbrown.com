        Hello! My name is Hayden Brown, as you could probably tell from the title of this website. This is my humble corner
        of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a fully self-taught full-stack developer and learning graphics designer from the East Midlands, UK, and I have
        an interest in technology and music. I'm also learning music production!
    </p>

    <h3 id="tech">What technology do you have?</h3>
    <p>
        You can see my computers and things by looking at my <a href="/tech">technology page</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="inline-heading" id="portfolio">Do you have a portfolio?</h3>
    <p>
        You can probably find what you need by <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">taking a look at
            my GitHub page</a>, but I currently don't have a formal portfolio.
    </p>
    <h3 class="inline-heading" id="programming-languages">What programming languages do you know?</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript, C#, C++, Java, Python (unfortunately), Go and a little bit of PHP.<br>
        There's probably more, but that's what I can remember at the moment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="inline-heading" id="website-tech">What did you use to make this website?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML (of course), SCSS and a little bit of JavaScript. It's hosted on Vercel and uses Jekyll as a CMS.
